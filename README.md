# LinkinME
Connect LinkedinAPI and OpenAI to create a summary of you.
Originally a small group in class project, but taking too long for the time. Turned into my personal project. 

## purpose:
program that passes LinkedIn API to Open AI, to generate a series of analysis on your strengths. Help you marketing yourself, and produce reliable resume content. 

## setting up python environment for openai lib:
1. run the following code
  ```
  import sys
  print(sys.executable)
  ```
2. record your file path of python.exe that you are using.

3. use the path to install openai:
